# Module 3 - Automation

---

## Module 2 Topics

We learned:

1. **High-level framework** → simplifies web development  
2. **Eloquent ORM** → PHP functions instead of raw SQL  
3. **REST APIs** → easy with MVC scaffolding  
4. **Security** → middleware makes APIs secure  

---

## Module 2 Issues

Challenges remained:

1. Installation was **difficult and error-prone**  
2. Configurations were **hard to manage**  
3. **Windows users** depended on WSL2 for automation  

---

## Module 3 as the Solution

Automation fixes these problems:

1. **Docker** → no more manual installation/configuration  
2. **Windows users** → use Docker instead of WSL2 Linux  
3. **Containers** → Laravel, Nginx, MySQL run independently but work together to deliver a REST API app  

---

## Even More Automation

Beyond servers:

1. **Hugo** → generate professional websites from Markdown  
2. **GitHub.io** → publish sites for free  
3. **GitHub Actions** → automate build & publish  

Everyone has **identical builds** and can publish seamlessly.  

---

## Module 3 Goals

By the end of Module 3, students will:

1. Use **Docker** to build and run Laravel/Nginx/MySQL REST APIs  
2. Use **Marp** to build and publish slides/documents  
3. Automate publishing to **GitHub.io** with GitHub Actions  

---

## Module 3 Structure

Same as previous modules:

1. **Lecture** → `lecture/` directory  
2. **PDF slides** → `pdf/` directory  
3. **Code (scripts & sources)** → `code/` directory  
4. **Questions** → `questions/` directory  

---

## Preparation for Module 3

**Windows Users** must:  
1. Install **Docker** and **Hugo** (HW1)  
2. Register on **GitHub** and create a repository (HW1)
