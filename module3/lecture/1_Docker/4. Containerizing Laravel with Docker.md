# Laravel with Composer Managing Multi-Container Setup

Professional Laravel Development with Container Orchestration

---

## Why Composer + Docker for Laravel?

### Best of Both Worlds:

```txt
Composer Strengths:
✅ Laravel dependency management
✅ Automated scripts and tasks
✅ Package installation and updates
✅ Development workflow optimization

Docker Strengths:
✅ Environment consistency
✅ Service isolation
✅ Production deployment
✅ Infrastructure as code
```

### The Synergy:

**Composer manages Laravel complexity, Docker manages infrastructure complexity**

---

## Architecture Overview

### Complete Laravel Stack:

```txt
[Browser] → [NGINX] → [PHP-FPM] → [Laravel App] → [MySQL]
              ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓
          [Static]   [Composer]   [Artisan]   [Redis Cache]
            Files    Dependencies  Commands    Session Store
```

### Management Approach:

- **Composer**: Handles Laravel dependencies, scripts, and automation
- **Docker**: Provides consistent runtime environment
- **Laravel**: Application framework and business logic
- **Artisan**: Laravel's command-line interface

---

## `setup.sh`

Instead of giving commands manually, we can use a shell script `setup.sh` (in `code/4_Docker/4. Containerizing Laravel with Docker`).

1. Copy the directory (code/4_Docker/4. Containerizing Laravel with Docker) to anything you choose to use, for example, `~/ex`.
2. Change to the copied directory (`cd ~/ex`).
3. Run the `setup.sh` to make a Laravel project (`bash setup.sh`).
    - It will generate a `hello` Laravel project in the directory.
4. You can change the project name with `bash setup.sh YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`.

---

### For Windows Users

**In case you use WSL2:**

You can run this script without problem, but be sure to run `dos2unix setup.sh` when you have an EOL (End of Line) issue (such as  $'\r': command not found).

**In case you can't use WSL2:**

1. Copy the directory.
2. Change to the copied directory.
3. Run each command line by line to get the same results.

---

### What is this script?

- Creates a new web application (Laravel)
- Puts it in containers (Docker)
- Sets up a database
- Makes everything work together automatically

**Like ordering a pizza** 🍕: You just run one command, and everything is prepared for you!

---

### 📋 Step 1: Getting Ready

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
```

**What happens:**

- The script starts
- `set -e` = "Stop if anything goes wrong" (safety first!)
- Sets up pretty colors for messages (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)

**Think of it as:** Putting on your apron before cooking 👨‍🍳

---

### 📝 Step 2: Choose Your Project Name

```bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    LARAVEL_DIR="hello"
else
    LARAVEL_DIR=$1
fi
```

**What happens:**

- If you don't give a name → uses "hello"
- If you do give a name → uses your name

**Examples:**

- `./setup.sh` → creates "hello" project
- `./setup.sh myapp` → creates "myapp" project

---

### 🏗️ Step 3: Create Laravel Project

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel "$LARAVEL_DIR"
```

**What happens:**

- Downloads Laravel (a web framework)
- Creates all the necessary files
- Like downloading and installing an app on your phone

**Analogy:** Building a house foundation 🏠

- Laravel = the basic structure of your web application

---

### 📁 Step 4: Copy Docker Files

```bash
cp -r "$SCRIPT_DIR/docker" .
cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/docker-compose.yml" .
```

**What happens:**

- Copies special Docker configuration files
- These tell Docker how to set up your containers

**Analogy:** Copying a recipe 📝

- The recipe tells Docker how to "cook" your application

---

### 🔧 Step 5: Update Configuration

```bash
sed -i "s|\./hello:|./${LARAVEL_DIR}:|g" docker-compose.yml
```

**What happens:**

- Updates the configuration to use YOUR project name
- Changes "hello" to whatever name you chose

**Analogy:** Writing your name on your homework 📝

- Makes sure Docker knows which project is yours

---

### ⚙️ Step 6: Environment Setup

```bash
cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/.env.docker" "$LARAVEL_DIR/.env"
```

**What happens:**

- Copies database connection settings
- Sets up environment variables (like settings)

**Analogy:** Programming your TV remote 📺

- Tells Laravel how to connect to the database

---

### 🐳 Step 7: Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**What happens:**

- Starts 3 containers:
  - **Web Server** (runs your Laravel app)
  - **Database** (stores your data)
  - **PHP** (runs your code)

**Analogy:** Starting a restaurant 🍽️

- Kitchen (PHP), Dining room (Web Server), Storage (Database)

---

### ⏳ Step 8: Wait and Check

```bash
sleep 15
# Check if MySQL is ready...
```

**What happens:**

- Waits for containers to start fully
- Tests database connection multiple times
- Like waiting for your computer to boot up

**Why wait?** Containers need time to initialize, just like apps on your phone

---

### 🔑 Step 9: Generate Security Key

```bash
docker exec laravel-php php artisan key:generate
```

**What happens:**

- Creates a unique security key for your app
- This key encrypts sensitive data

**Analogy:** Creating a password for your app 🔐

- Every Laravel app needs its own unique key

---

### 🗄️ Step 10: Set Up Database

```bash
docker exec laravel-php php artisan migrate
```

**What happens:**

- Creates database tables
- Sets up the database structure

**Analogy:** Building shelves in a warehouse 📦

- Creates organized storage for your data

---

### 🎉 Step 11: Success Message

```bash
echo "🌐 Your Laravel application is ready!"
echo "   Visit: http://localhost:8080"
```

**What you get:**

- A working web application
- Accessible at `<http://localhost:8080>`
- Useful commands to manage your app

---

### 🧠 What Actually Happened?

**Before:** Nothing ❌
**After:** Complete web development environment ✅

1. **Laravel App** → Your web application code
2. **Database** → Stores your data (users, posts, etc.)
3. **Web Server** → Serves your app to browsers
4. **All Connected** → Everything talks to each other

---

### 📊 The Big Picture

```

---

### 🛠️ Useful Commands You Get

After setup, you can use:

- `composer run stop` → Stop everything
- `composer run shell` → Access the app container
- `composer run artisan` → Run Laravel commands
- `docker-compose logs -f` → See what's happening

**Like TV remote buttons** 📺 - each does something specific!

---

## Configuration Files

To automate the deployment of a Laravel project using Docker, we need multiple configuration files.

```txt
📁 Laravel Docker Project
├── 🔧 .env.docker           ← Laravel app settings
├── 🐳 docker-compose.yml    ← Container coordinator
├── 📦 composer.json         ← PHP package manager
├── 🔧 .env                  ← composer settings
└── 📁 docker/               ← Container recipes
    ├── 🐘 php/
    │   ├── Dockerfile       ← PHP container recipe
    │   └── php.ini          ← PHP development settings
    ├── 🌐 nginx/
    │   ├── Dockerfile       ← Web server recipe
    │   └── nginx.conf       ← Web server settings
    └── 🗄️ mysql/
        ├── Dockerfile       ← Database container recipe
        └── init.sql         ← Database initialization
```

---

### 🔧 File #1: `.env.docker` (Laravel Application Settings)

This will be copied into the Laravel project directory as `.env`.

**What is it?** Environment variables file for Laravel
**Think of it as:** Your app's preferences file

**Key sections:**

```bash
APP_NAME="Laravel Docker App"     # What to call your app
APP_DEBUG=true                    # Show errors (helpful for learning)
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080     # Where people find your app
```

**Like:** Setting your name, phone wallpaper, and notification preferences

---

## 🗄️ Database Settings in `.env.docker`

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql          # Type of database (MySQL)
DB_HOST=mysql               # Where the database lives (container name)
DB_PORT=3306                # Database door number
DB_DATABASE=laravel         # Database name
DB_USERNAME=laravel         # Username to access database
DB_PASSWORD=laravel_password # Password to access database
```

Laravel knows the database information from these settings.

**Analogy:** Like giving your app the address, apartment number, and keys to the database building

---

## 🔧 Understanding Two Types of Environment Variables

### 📱 Laravel App Configuration (`.env.docker` → `hello/.env`)

**Purpose:** Tell Laravel **HOW** to connect to MySQL  
**Used by:** Laravel application code at runtime

```bash
# These variables tell Laravel:
DB_HOST=mysql               # "Connect to container named 'mysql'"
DB_DATABASE=laravel         # "Use database called 'laravel'"
DB_USERNAME=laravel         # "Login as user 'laravel'"
DB_PASSWORD=laravel_password # "Use this password"
```

---

Without using Docker, we use the IP address to specify the DB_HOST.

```bash
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 # <--
DB_PORT=3306
```

---

#### 📧 Other Services in `.env.docker`

```bash
MAIL_MAILER=log             # How to send emails (log = fake for testing)
CACHE_DRIVER=database       # Where to store temporary data
SESSION_DRIVER=file         # How to remember logged-in users
```

**Think of it as:** Telling your app which postal service to use, where to put sticky notes, and how to remember friends

---

## 🐳 File #2: `docker-compose.yml`

### The Orchestra Conductor

**What is it?** Tells Docker how to run multiple containers together  
**Think of it as:** A conductor's sheet music 🎼

**Three main "musicians":**

- 🌐 **nginx** (Web Server) - Greets visitors
- 🐘 **php** (Application) - Runs Laravel code  
- 🗄️ **mysql** (Database) - Stores data

---

## 🌐 Nginx Service Configuration (1/3)

```yaml
nginx:
  build: ./docker/nginx        # Use our custom recipe
  container_name: laravel-nginx # Name this container
  ports:
    - "8080:80"               # Map port 8080 (outside) to 80 (inside)
  volumes:
    - ./hello:/var/www/html   # Share Laravel code with container
  depends_on:
    - php                     # Wait for PHP to start first
```

**Analogy:** Setting up a receptionist desk that forwards visitors to the correct department

---

## 🐘 PHP Service Configuration (2/3)

```yaml
php:
  build: ./docker/php          # Use our PHP recipe
  container_name: laravel-php  # Name this container
  volumes:
    - ./hello:/var/www/html    # Share Laravel code
  depends_on:
    mysql:
      condition: service_healthy # Wait for database to be ready
```

In the volumes, the Laravel project (hello) is mapped to internal /var/www/html, and other files are copied into the container.

```bash
COPY php.ini /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/laravel.ini
```

**Like:** Setting up a chef who needs access to the kitchen (code) and waits for ingredients (database) to arrive

---

## 🗄️ MySQL Service Configuration (3/3)

```yaml
mysql:
  build: ./docker/mysql            # Use our custom MySQL recipe
  container_name: laravel-mysql
  environment:                      # ✅ Pass environment variables from host
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    - MYSQL_DATABASE=${MYSQL_DATABASE}
    - MYSQL_USER=${MYSQL_USER}
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
  volumes:
    - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
    - ./docker/mysql/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql  # Database initialization
  networks:
    - laravel-network
```

From the environment variablse, Docker automatically runs the equivalent SQL.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS student_api;
CREATE USER 'student'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON student_api.* TO 'student'@'%';
```

---

### healthcheck

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --silent"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 30s
```

**Like:** Setting up a secure filing cabinet with specific locks and keys 🗃️🔐

---

#### 🗄️ Understanding MySQL Health Checks

**What is a Health Check?**  
A health check is like asking "Are you ready to work?" before giving someone a task.

**Breaking it down:**

- `mysqladmin ping`: Tests if MySQL can accept connections
- `-h 127.0.0.1`: Connect to localhost (more reliable than "mysql")
- `-u root`: Use root user credentials
- `-p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Use password from environment variable
- `--silent`: Don't show verbose output

---

**Note:**

- `CMD-SHELL` allows shell variable expansion (`$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`)
- `start_period: 30s` gives MySQL time to initialize without marking it unhealthy
- This prevents Laravel from trying to connect before MySQL is truly ready

**Like:** Making sure the librarian is at their desk before asking for a book!

---

### 🐳 Container Configuration by Docker Compose (`.env` file)

**Purpose:** Tell MySQL container **WHAT** to create  
**Used by:** Docker Compose when starting containers

```bash
# These variables tell the MySQL container:
MYSQL_DATABASE=laravel         # "Create database called 'laravel'"
MYSQL_USER=laravel            # "Create user called 'laravel'"
MYSQL_PASSWORD=laravel_password # "Give user this password"
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root       # "Set root password"
```

The PHP (Laravel) container will use the MySQL database generated from the MySQL container.

---

#### ⚠️ Warning!

- Composer doesn't create a MySQL database.
- MySQL database is created INSIDE the MySQL container, not on your local machine.
- .env configures the container to create the database inside the container.
- No MySQL installed on your local machine - everything runs in containers.

---

#### 🔧 Hint for backing up the DB!

The MySQL database is created INSIDE the MySQL container, so we need to keep a backup.

```mysql
# Create SQL backup file on your local machine
docker exec laravel-mysql mysqldump -u root -proot laravel > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
docker exec -i laravel-mysql mysql -u root -proot laravel < backup.sql
```

---

We can add a backup script to `composer.json` (will be explained in the next section).

```json
"scripts": {
  "backup": "docker exec laravel-mysql mysqldump -u root -proot laravel > backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql",
  "restore": "docker exec -i laravel-mysql mysql -u root -proot laravel"
}
```

---

## 📦 File #3: `composer.json`

### PHP Package Manager & Shortcuts

**What is it?** Tells PHP what libraries to install and provides shortcuts  
**Think of it as:** Your app's shopping list and remote control 📺🛒

**Two main parts:**

1. **Dependencies** - What libraries to download
2. **Scripts** - Shortcut commands

---

### 📚 Dependencies in `composer.json`

```json
"require": {
  "php": "^8.1",              # Need PHP version 8.1 or newer
  "laravel/framework": "^10.10" # Need Laravel version 10.10+
}
```

**Like:** Telling your assistant "I need a car (PHP 8.1+) and GPS system (Laravel 10.10+)"

**Result:** Composer automatically downloads and installs everything you need!

---

### 🎮 Scripts (Shortcuts) in `composer.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "docker-compose up -d",      # Start everything
  "stop": "docker-compose down",        # Stop everything  
  "shell": "docker exec -it laravel-php bash", # Access PHP container
  "artisan": "docker exec laravel-php php artisan" # Run Laravel commands
}
```

**Usage:** `composer run start` instead of typing long Docker commands (such as `docker-compose up -d`)!  
**Like:** TV remote buttons instead of manually adjusting settings

---

## 🐘 File #4: `docker/php/Dockerfile`

### Recipe for PHP Container

**What is it?** Instructions to build a custom PHP container  
**Think of it as:** Recipe for a specialized chef 👨‍🍳

**Steps:**

1. Start with basic PHP (base chef)
2. Install extra tools (give the chef special skills)
3. Configure settings (teach Chef your preferences)

---

## 🔧 PHP Dockerfile Breakdown

```dockerfile
FROM php:8.2-fpm                    # Start with PHP 8.2
RUN apt-get install git curl zip... # Install system tools
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql # Add database connection ability
COPY --from=composer /usr/bin/composer # Add package manager
WORKDIR /var/www/html               # Set kitchen location
RUN chown -R www-data:www-data...   # Set proper permissions
```

**Result:** A PHP container that can run Laravel and connect to MySQL! 🚀

---

### 🐘 What is `php:8.2-fpm`?

- It’s a **Docker base image** built on **Debian/Ubuntu (Linux)**.  
- Already includes:
  - PHP 8.2 (compiled & ready)  
  - FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)  
- Maintained officially on **Docker Hub**.

### ✅ Benefits of Using `php:8.2-fpm`

- **Preconfigured PHP**: Maintained by Docker & PHP team  
- **Security updates**: Patched automatically in official image  
- **Consistency**: Same environment across all developers  
- **Less code**: No need to build PHP yourself

---

## 🌐 File #5: `docker/nginx/Dockerfile`  

### Recipe for Web Server Container

**What is it?** Instructions to build a custom web server  
**Think of it as:** Recipe for a specialized receptionist 👩‍💼

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine              # Start with a lightweight web server
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/... # Give it our custom rules
RUN mkdir -p /var/www/html...  # Create workspace
RUN chown -R nginx:nginx...    # Set permissions
EXPOSE 80                      # Open door on port 80
```

---

### What is `nginx:alpine`?

It means the Nginx container uses Alpine Linux.

- Smaller image size  
- Faster builds & deployments  
- More secure containers  
- Efficient and portable base for web apps

---

## 🗄️ File #6: `docker/mysql/Dockerfile`

### Recipe for Database Container

**What is it?** Instructions to build a custom MySQL container  
**Think of it as:** Recipe for a specialized data manager 🗃️

```dockerfile
FROM mysql:8.0

# Allow remote connections (for Docker networking)
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=%

# Minimal configuration for MySQL 8.0 compatibility
RUN echo '[mysqld]' > /etc/mysql/conf.d/laravel.cnf \
    && echo 'default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password' >> /etc/mysql/conf.d/laravel.cnf

EXPOSE 3306
```

---

**Benefits of using Dockerfile**

- **No Hardcoded Values**: Environment variables come from docker-compose.yml
- **Laravel Compatibility**: Uses `mysql_native_password` authentication
- **Flexible Configuration**: Same Dockerfile works for dev/staging/production
- **Security**: Credentials managed externally, not baked into image

**Result:** A clean, configurable MySQL container that gets settings from external sources!

---

### 🐬 What is `mysql:8.0`?

- An **official MySQL Docker image** based on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu).  
- Includes:
  - MySQL 8.0 server pre-installed  
  - Default configuration files  
  - Scripts to initialize users/databases  

---

## 🗄️ File #7: `docker/mysql/init.sql`

### Database Initialization Script

**What is it?** SQL script that runs automatically when the container first starts  
**Think of it as:** Setting up the filing system in your new office 🗂️

```sql
-- Simple Laravel database initialization
-- ensure the database exists - Laravel migrations will handle the rest
USE laravel;

-- Simple test to ensure the database is ready
SELECT 'Database ready for Laravel!' as status;
```

---

### 🎆 How Initialization Works:

1. **First Container Start**: MySQL runs all `.sql` files in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`
2. **Volume Mounting**: `./docker/mysql/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`
3. **Automatic Execution**: No manual intervention needed
4. **One-Time Only**: Only runs on a fresh database (not on restarts)

**Perfect for:** Database seeding, initial user setup, or schema creation!

---

## ⚙️ File #8: `docker/nginx/nginx.conf`

### Web Server Rules & Behavior

**What is it?** Detailed instructions for how the web server should behave  
**Think of it as:** A receptionist's detailed job description 📋

**Key responsibilities:**

- Listen on port 80 for visitors
- Send PHP files to the PHP container for processing
- Serve static files (images, CSS) directly
- Add security headers to protect users

---

### 🌐 Nginx Configuration Sections

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;                        # Listen on port 80
  root /var/www/html/public;        # Laravel's front door
  
  location / {                      # For regular pages
    try_files $uri /index.php;      # Try file, then Laravel
  }
  
  location ~ \.php$ {               # For PHP files
    fastcgi_pass laravel-php:9000;  # Send to PHP container
  }
  
  location ~* \.(css|js|png)$ {     # For static files
    expires 1y;                     # Cache for 1 year
  }
}
```

---

## 🐘 File #9: `docker/php/php.ini`

### PHP Engine Settings

**What is it?** Detailed settings for how PHP should run  
**Think of it as:** Engine tuning for a race car 🏎️

**Key categories:**

- **Memory & Speed** - How much RAM to use, how long scripts can run
- **File Uploads** - How big files can be uploaded
- **Security** - What PHP is allowed to do
- **Error Reporting** - How to show problems (helpful for learning!)

---

## 🔧 Important PHP Settings Explained

```ini
memory_limit = 512M              # Use up to 512MB RAM
max_execution_time = 300         # Scripts can run for 5 minutes max
upload_max_filesize = 50M        # Allow 50MB file uploads
display_errors = On              # Show errors (good for learning!)
```

**Analogy:** Like setting limits on your car - max speed, fuel tank size, safety features 🚗

**For Students:** `display_errors = On` means you'll see helpful error messages!

---

### Building for Production

The `docker/php/` also has `php-production.ini` and `Docker.prod` files for production release.

#### Development vs Production Dockerfiles

| Aspect             | Development      | Production                         |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Build Strategy** | Single stage     | Multi-stage build                  |
| **Code Copying**   | Volume mounted   | Copied into image                  |
| **Dependencies**   | All (dev + prod) | Production only                    |
| **Optimizations**  | None             | Laravel caching, composer optimize |
| **Security**       | Root user        | Non-root user (www-data)           |
| **Size**           | Larger           | Smaller, optimized                 |

---

#### Development vs Production PHP Configuration

| Setting                 | Development | Production | Why Different?                         |
|-------------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Memory Limit**        | 512M        | 256M       | Production needs resource control      |
| **Execution Time**      | 300s        | 60s        | Prevent long-running scripts in prod   |
| **Error Display**       | ON          | OFF        | Don't expose errors to users           |
| **File Upload Size**    | 50M         | 10M        | Security and resource control          |
| **OPcache Validation**  | Enabled     | Disabled   | Performance vs development flexibility |
| **Dangerous Functions** | Allowed     | Disabled   | Security hardening                     |

## 🔗 How All Files Work Together

1. docker-compose.yml reads Dockerfiles
   ↓
2. Dockerfiles build containers using .ini/.conf files  
   ↓
3. Containers start up with custom settings
   ↓
4. Laravel app uses the .env file (copied from the .env.docker) for configuration
   ↓
5. composer.json provides easy commands to manage everything
```

**Like:** Building a complete restaurant with specialized staff, each knowing their job! 🍽️

## 💡 Why So Many Files?

**Separation of Concerns** 🎯

- Each file has ONE specific job
- Easy to modify without breaking others
- Different team members can work on different parts

**Like:** Having separate instruction manuals for:

- 📺 TV remote (not mixing with microwave instructions)
- 🚗 Car manual (separate from house manual)
- 👕 Washing machine (different from dishwasher)

## 🔍 What Happens When You Run `setup.sh`?

1. **Creates Laravel project** 📁
2. **Copies all config files** 📋
3. **Updates docker-compose.yml** with your project name 🔧
4. **Docker reads Dockerfiles** → Builds containers 🏗️
5. **Containers use .ini/.conf files** → Custom settings ⚙️
6. **Laravel uses .env.docker** → Connects to database 🔗
7. **composer.json provides shortcuts** → Easy management 🎮

## 🛠️ Practical Tips for Students

**To modify settings:**

- Change app name → Edit `.env.docker`  
- Add PHP extensions → Edit `php/Dockerfile`
- Change web server behavior → Edit `nginx.conf`
- Add shortcuts → Edit `composer.json` scripts

**Golden Rule:** 🥇 Always test changes with `composer run start`

**Safety Tip:** 🚨 Make backups before changing configuration files!
