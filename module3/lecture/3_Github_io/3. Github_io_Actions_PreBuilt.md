# GitHub Actions: Using Pre-Built Actions

From Writing Commands to Using Ready-Made Tools

---

## What You Already Know

### **Your Hello World Action:**

```yaml
- name: Greet the world
  run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions!"    ← You wrote this command
  
- name: Show date  
  run: date                                ← You wrote this command
```

### **Key Points:**

- ✅ **`run:`** = Write your own commands
- ✅ **Simple commands** like `echo`, `date`, `ls`
- ✅ **Works great** for basic tasks

**But what about complex tasks?**

---

## The Problem with Complex Tasks

### **What if you want to:**

- 📥 **Download your code** from GitHub
- 🏗️ **Install Hugo** with all dependencies
- 🌐 **Deploy to GitHub Pages** with proper permissions
- 🔧 **Configure SSL certificates**
- 📊 **Set up caching** for faster builds

---

### **Writing this yourself:**

```bash
# This would be 50+ lines of complex commands
curl -L https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/...
tar -xzf hugo_extended_...
chmod +x hugo
./hugo version
# ... and 46 more lines of configuration
```

**😱 Too complicated!**

---

## Solution: Pre-Built Actions

### **Think of GitHub Actions Marketplace like an App Store:**

📱 **App Store for Your Phone:**

- Don't write your own camera app
- Download Instagram (someone else built it)
- Just use it!

🤖 **Actions Store for GitHub:**

- Don't write your own deployment code
- Use `actions/deploy-pages@v2` (someone else built it)
- Just use it!

---

### **Key Difference:**

```yaml
run: echo "Hello"           ← You write the command
uses: actions/checkout@v4   ← You use someone else's tool
```

---

## Understanding `uses` vs `run`

### **`run:` = Write Your Own**

```yaml
- name: Say hello
  run: echo "Hello World!"              ← A simple command you write

- name: List files  
  run: ls -la                          ← Another command you write

- name: Multiple commands
  run: |                               ← Multiple commands you write
    echo "Starting..."
    date
    echo "Done!"
```

---

### **`uses:` = Use Pre-Built Tool**

```yaml
- name: Download code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4             ← Pre-built tool

- name: Deploy website
  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2         ← Pre-built tool
```

---

## Understanding Action Names

### **Action Name Format:**

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
      ↑      ↑       ↑
   owner/  name   version
```

---

### **Breaking it Down:**

- **`actions`** = The organization/company that made it
- **`checkout`** = What the action does
- **`@v4`** = Version number (like app version 4.0)

### **Examples:**

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4        # GitHub's official code downloader
uses: actions/setup-node@v3      # GitHub's Node.js installer  
uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2    # GitHub's website deployer
```

---

## The Three Key Actions for Hugo

### **1. actions/checkout@v4**

```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

---

**What it does:**

```txt
📥 Downloads your repository code
📁 Makes it available in the virtual machine on GitHub
✅ Like "git clone" but automatic
```

**Why you need it:**

- GitHub Actions starts with an **empty computer**
- You need to **get your Hugo files** first
- This action **downloads everything** from your repository

---

### **2. actions/configure-pages@v3**

```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  id: pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
```

---

**What it does:**

```txt
🔧 Prepares GitHub Pages hosting
🌐 Sets up the website URL
🔒 Configures permissions
✅ Gets everything ready for deployment
```

**Why you need it:**

- GitHub Pages needs **special setup**
- This action **handles all the complex configuration**
- Without it, deployment will **fail**

---

### **3. actions/deploy-pages@v2**

```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  id: deployment
  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

---

**What it does:**

```txt
🚀 Takes your built website
📤 Uploads it to GitHub Pages
🌐 Makes it live on the internet
✅ Your website goes online!
```

**Why you need it:**

- This is the **magic step** that publishes your site
- Handles all the **complex deployment process**
- Without it, your site stays **only on the build machine**

---

## Understanding `with:` Parameters

### **Some Actions Need Extra Information:**

```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:                              ← Extra settings
    submodules: recursive            ← Download submodules too
```

---

### **Think of `with:` like Settings:**

📱 **Installing an App:**

```txt
Install Camera App
Settings:
  - Quality: High
  - Flash: Auto
  - Location: Enabled
```

🤖 **Using an Action:**

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
with:
  submodules: recursive
  fetch-depth: 0
```

---

## Understanding `id:` References

### **Why Some Actions Have `id:`:**

```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  id: pages                          ← Give this step a name
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v3

- name: Build with Hugo
  run: |
    hugo --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
                    ↑
                    Use output from the "pages" step.
```

---

### **Think of `id:` like Variables:**

```txt
Step 1: pages = Setup Pages (saves website URL)
Step 2: Use the URL from the pages step
```

**Common pattern in Hugo deployment!**

---

## Complete Example: Hello World vs Hugo

### **Your Simple Hello World:**

```yaml
name: My First Action
on: push
jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Greet the world
        run: echo "Hello!"           ← Simple command
```

### **Professional Hugo Deployment:**

```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo Site
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4           ← Download code
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v3    ← Setup hosting
      - run: hugo --minify                  ← Build site
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2       ← Deploy online
```

---

## Why Use Pre-Built Actions?

### **Benefits:**

✅ **Tested by thousands** of developers  
✅ **Maintained by experts** who understand the complexity  
✅ **Updated automatically** when GitHub changes  
✅ **Save time** - no need to write complex code  
✅ **More reliable** than custom scripts  

---

### **Comparison:**

```txt
Writing your own deployment: 200+ lines, many bugs
Using actions/deploy-pages@v2: 1 line, works perfectly
```

### **Professional Standard:**

- Real companies use pre-built actions
- Writing everything yourself is **not professional**
- Using the right tools shows **good judgment**

---

## Common Hugo Actions Workflow

### **Complete Hugo Deployment Pattern:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Get the code
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      
      # 2. Install Hugo
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
```

---

```yaml
      # 3. Setup Pages hosting
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      
      # 4. Build the site
      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify
      
      # 5. Deploy online
      - name: Deploy
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```
