## Question 1.1

How do you log into MySQL for the first time?

## Answer
- Windows (XAMPP) → open the XAMPP Shell (button in XAMPP Control Panel) or Command Prompt.
- mysql -u root -p
-u root → log in as the root user (default admin account).
-p → tells MySQL to prompt for a password.
- If using XAMPP, the root account usually has no password by default, so just press Enter when prompted.
- If installed via the MySQL installer, you should use the root password you set during installation.
