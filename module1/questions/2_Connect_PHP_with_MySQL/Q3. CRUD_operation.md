# Q3. CRUD Operations using MySQLi

---

## Question 3.1

What does CRUD stand for, and what are the four basic database operations?

**Answer:**
Create → Insert new data

Read → Select or retrieve data

Update → Modify existing data

Delete → Remove data

---

## Question 3.2

This is the complete PHP MySQLi skeleton connection code that will be used for CRUD operations. Fill in ??# (# is a number).

```php
$conn = new ??1($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->??2) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

**Answer:**

??1 - mysqli
??2 - connect_error

---

## Question 3.3

This is a standard pattern for executing prepared statements in MySQLi. What are ??#

1. **Make a SQL statement**
2. **Call `??1()`** → returns a statement object
3. **Call `??2()`** → bind values to `?` placeholders
4. **Call `??3()`** → run the query

**Answer:**

??1 - prepare
??2 - bind_param
??3 - execute

---

## Question 3.4

We have this $sql SQL statement string.
Make a **SQL statement** that does the following:
Call **`prepare()`** → returns a statement object  
Call **`bind_param()`** → bind values to `?` placeholders  
Call **`execute()`** → run the query  

```php
$sql = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
```

**Answer:**
```php
$sql = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
$stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
$stmt->bind_param("sis", $name, $age, $major);
$stmt->execute();
```
---

## Question 3.5

This is an SQL string to CREATE (insert) a new student record using prepared statements. What are ??#

```php
$sql = "??1 ??2 students (name, age, major) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
```

**Answer:**

??1 - INSERT
??2 - INTO

---

## Question 3.6

This is an SQL string to READ (select) all student records from the database. What are ??#

```php
$sql = "??1 id, name, age, major ??2 students";
```

**Answer:**

??1 - SELECT
??2 - FROM

---

## Question 3.7

This function retrieves each row from the result set as an associative array. What is the name of this function (Don't include () in your answer)?

**Answer:**
fetch_assoc

---

## Question 3.8

Explain briefly why the `fetch_assoc()` function is useful?

**Answer:**
Because it returns each row as an associative array with column names as keys, making the data easier to read and work with in PHP compared to numeric indexes.

---

## Question 3.9

This is an SQL string to READ (select) a specific student by ID using prepared statements. What are ??#

```php
$sql = "??1 id, name, age, major ??2 students ??3 id = ?";
```

**Answer:**

??1 - SELECT
??2 - FROM
??3 - WHERE

---

## Question 3.10

**`$conn->query($sql)`** command runs a direct SQL query, no prepared statements, but prepared statements (`$stmt->execute(); $result = $stmt->get_result();`) execute a prepared statement and get the result.

Explain why prepared statements are preferred.

**Answer:**
Prepared statements are preferred because they:
1. Prevent SQL injection by separating SQL structure from user input.
2. Improve performance when running the same query multiple times with different values.
3. Provide cleaner, safer code with automatic parameter handling.

---

## Question 3.11

This is an SQL string to UPDATE an existing student record. What are ??#

```php
$sql = "??1 students ??2 name = ?, age = ?, major = ? ??3 id = ?";
```

**Answer:**

??1 - UPDATE
??2 - SET
??3 - WHERE

---

## Question 3.12

This is an SQL string to DELETE a student record by ID. What are ??#

```php
$sql = "??1 ??2 students ??3 id = ?";
```

**Answer:**

??1 - DELETE
??2 - FROM
??3 - WHERE
