## Question 4

What is the difference between single quotes and double quotes in PHP strings?

**Answer:**
Single quotes: variables are not parsed, they’re treated as plain text.

Double quotes: variables are parsed (their values are inserted).
```php
$name = "Megan";

echo 'Hello $name';  // Output: Hello $name
echo "Hello $name";  // Output: Hello Megan
```
---
Escape sequences

Single quotes: only recognize \\ (backslash) and \' (single quote).

Double quotes: recognize many escape sequences like \n, \t, \", etc.
```php
echo 'Line 1\nLine 2';  // Output: Line 1\nLine 2
echo "Line 1\nLine 2";  // Output: Line 1
                        //         Line 2
```

## Question 12

This is a PHP function that uses pass by value. Rewrite this function to use pass by reference.

```php
function incVal(int $x): void {
  $x++;
}
```

**Answer:**
```php
<?php
function incVal(int &$x): void {
    $x++;
}
```
---

## Question 13

```php
function decVal(int &$x): void {
  $x--;
}
$x = 20;
decVal($x);
echo $x;
```

What value is going to be printed?

**Answer:** 
- $x = 20; → $x starts with value 20.

- decVal($x); → $x is passed by reference into the function.

- Inside the function: $x-- decreases the value by 1 → $x becomes 19.

- echo $x; → **prints 19**
