## Question 5

Create a new Student object ($s1) with id=100, name='Alice Johnson', email='alice@university.edu'.

**Answer:**
```php
// Create a new Student object
$s1 = new Student(100, 'Alice Johnson', 'alice@university.edu');

// Example output
echo $s1->name;  // Outputs: Alice Johnson
?>
```

---

## Question 6

Write a public method called `getEmail()` that returns the student's email as string type:

**Answer:**
```php
    // Public method to return email
    public function getEmail(): string {
        return $this->email;
    }
}

// Example usage
$s1 = new Student(100, 'Alice Johnson', 'alice@university.edu');
echo $s1->getEmail();  // Outputs: alice@university.edu
?>
```
---

## Question 7

Explain this method toArray. What does it do?

```php
public function toArray(): array {
  return [
    'id'    => $this->id,
    'name'  => $this->name,
    'email' => $this->email,
  ];
}
```

**Answer:** toArray() makes it easy to export an object’s data into a simple array form — useful for debugging, JSON encoding, or passing data around.

---

## Question 8

What's the name of the function to encode a PHP array into a JSON string?

**Answer:**
The function is json_encode().

---

## Question 9

Complete this code to display a Student object as a JSON string:

```php
$student = new Student(1, 'Bob Wilson', 'bob@university.edu');

echo ???;
```

**Answer:**
```php
<?php
$student = new Student(1, 'Bob Wilson', 'bob@university.edu');

echo json_encode($student->toArray());
?>
```

---

## Question 10

Explain the difference between a class and an object using keywords such as 'blueprint' and 'thing'.

**Answer:**
A class is like a blueprint or plan. It defines what a thing should have — its properties (data) and methods (behavior).

- Example: a Student class defines that a student has id, name, and email, and methods like getEmail() or toArray().

An object is a thing created from that blueprint. It is an instance of a class with actual values.

- Example: $s1 = new Student(100, 'Alice', 'alice@university.edu') is an object — a real student thing with specific data.
