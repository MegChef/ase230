Different formats require different parsing approaches:

## Question 1.7

A PHP Framework converts complex raw HTTP

```http
GET /api?name=John&age=25 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
```

Into simple variable access through parsing:

```php
$method = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];  // "GET"
$name = $_GET['name'];                 // "John"
$age = $_GET['age'];                   // "25"
```

PHP is the only framework that can do this (True or False).
