# Q2. Request and Response in PHP

---

## Question 1

PHP automatically parses incoming HTTP requests and populates superglobal arrays. This is parsed results from raw HTTP. Fill in ??#

**Complex raw HTTP:**

```http
GET /api?name=John&age=25 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
```

**Simple PHP access:**

```php
$method = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];  // "GET"
$path = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];       // "/api?name=John&age=25"
$name = $_GET['??1'];                 // "John"
$age = $_GET['??2'];                   // "25"
```
---

**Answer:**

??1 - name
??2 - age

---

## Question 2

From this HTML request line, why we can use $_GET to retrieve "name=John" and "age=25"?

```txt
GET /api?name=John&age=25 HTTP/1.1
```

**Answer:**
We can use $_GET in PHP to retrieve "name=John" and "age=25" because of how the query string in the request line is structured and automatically parsed by PHP.
- /api → This is the path (the endpoint being requested).
- ?name=John&age=25 → Everything after ? is the query string.

---

It encodes key–value pairs separated by &.
- Here: name=John and age=25.

What PHP does automatically:
- The PHP engine parses the query string from the URL.
- Each key=value pair is stored in the $_GET superglobal array.

So, PHP gives you:

```php
$_GET['name']; // "John"
$_GET['age'];  // "25"
```

That’s why you can directly access them with $_GET — PHP has already split the query string into keys and values for you.

---

## Question 4

Users send an HTML form. Use the $_POST to access 'username' and 'password' information.

```html
<form method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username">
    <input type="password" name="password">
</form>
```

**Answer:**
When a user submits this form with method="post", the browser sends the form data in the HTTP request body (not in the URL).

PHP automatically parses that body and puts the key–value pairs into the $_POST superglobal array.

---

So, you can access them like this:

```html
$username = $_POST['username'];  
$password = $_POST['password'];  
```

$username will hold whatever the user typed into the text field.

$password will hold the entered password.

Example: If the user entered Alice and 1234, then:
```html
$username = "Alice";
$password = "1234";
```

## Question 3

How do you extract the path portion from a URL in PHP? Fill in ??#

```php
$path = $??1['REQUEST_URI'];
$path = ??2($path, PHP_URL_PATH); 
$path = trim($path, '/'); 
```

**Answer:**

??1 - _SERVER
??2 - parse_url
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] → gives the full request URI (path + query string).

parse_url(..., PHP_URL_PATH) → extracts just the path portion (ignores query string).

trim($path, '/') → removes leading/trailing slashes (optional, often for routing).

---

## Question 5

Users make a request using a web browser `http://example.com/abc?a=b&c=d`

What are the values?

- `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` =>
- `parse_url($path, PHP_URL_PATH)` =>
- `trim($path, '/')` =>

**Answer:**
- $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] => "/abc?a=b&c=d"
- parse_url($path, PHP_URL_PATH) => "/abc"
- trim($path, '/') => "abc"
  
---

## Question 6

The `parse_url()` function Parses a URL and returns its components. Fill in ??#

- Extracts only the ??1 part from a full URI
- Removes ??2 parameters, fragments, etc.
- Returns clean path for routing

```php
$path = parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH);
```

**Answer:**
??1 - path
??2 - query

---

## Question 7

We have to parse `GET /api HTTP/1.1` to get the request method (GET). This is PHP code to do that. Fill in ??#

```php
$method = $_SERVER['??1'];

if ($_SERVER['??1'] !== '??2') {
    sendError('Only GET requests are allowed', 405);
    exit;
}
```

**Answer:**

??1 - REQUEST_METHOD
??2 - GET

---

## Question 8

In the server side program in PHP, now we need to generate response.
How do you set response headers in PHP, when we need to return JSON? Fill in ???

```php
// Set content type as JSON
header('Content-Type: application/???');
```

**Answer:**
- json
  
---

## Question 9

When we need to set status code. What is the number for Not found (??1) and OK (??2).

```php
http_response_code(??1);  // Not Found
http_response_code(??2);  // OK
```

**Answer:**

??1 - 404
??2 - 200

---

## Question 10

This is a PHP function to send a JSON response. Fill in ??#

```php
function sendResponse($data, $message = 'Success') {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    echo ??1([
        'success' => true, 'message' => $message, 'data' => $data
    ], ??2);
}

// Usage
sendResponse(['name' => 'John'], 'User found');
```

**Answer:**

??1 - json_encode
??2 - JSON_PRETTY_PRINT

---

## Question 11

This is simple routing code snippet in PHP, I need to parse users' request and if the $path (endpoint) is 'api', I return JSON string. Fill in ???

```php
$path = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$path = parse_url($path, PHP_URL_PATH); 
$path = trim($path, '/'); 

switch ($path) {
    case '':
    case '???':
        $info = ['name' => 'API', 'version' => '1.0'];
        sendResponse($info, 'Welcome to API');
        break;
    ...
}
```
---

**Answer:**
 - api
---

## Question 12

This is PHP error handling function. Using this function, respond with 'Not found' message of 404 code.

```php
function sendError($message, $code = 400) {
    http_response_code($code);
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    echo json_encode([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => $message,
        'data' => null
    ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
}
```

**Answer:**
 - sendError('Not found', 404);

---

## Question 13

There are five key benefits of how PHP handles web development. What is missing?

1. **Superglobals** provide instant access to request data
2. **Built-in functions** handle complex parsing automatically
3. **Simple syntax** makes code readable and maintainable
4. **Rich ecosystem** of functions designed for web development

**Answer:**
- Cross-platform compatibility and wide server support
